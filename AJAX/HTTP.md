# HTTP
> HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents.

- HTTP/1.1: up-to-date version (more efficient)
- proxies: (proxy server) intermediate program/computer in a connection
    - caching (the cache can be public or private, like the browser cache)
    - filtering (like an antivirus scan or parental controls)
    - load balancing (to allow multiple servers to serve the different requests)
    - authentication (to control access to different resources)
    - logging (allowing the storage of historical information)
    - etc.
- caches: component that stores HTTP responses temporarily so that it can be used for subsequent HTTP requests
- user agent: primarily a browser
- stateless: there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same connection.
